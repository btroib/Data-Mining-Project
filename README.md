## Web Scraper

### Description:
***

This program scrapes Metacritic's website for data regarding gaming. There are 182 pages on Metacritics gaming rank, each page contains 100 games from highest to lowest Metacritic ranking. The program will save each page in HTML format in an output path (absolute or relative) designated by the user. This web_scraper is capable of scraping the following data from each game: Link, Rank, Title, Date (release), Platform, Meta Score, User Score and Game Summary. You can choose how many web pages you request to scrape as well as which data to scrape for.

### Usage:

```
The user must also add the number of pages and the category which should be scraped. See below a description of all possible commands:
