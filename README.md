## Web Scraper

### Program description:
***

This program scrapes Metacritic's website for data regarding gaming. There are 182 pages on Metacritics gaming rank, each page contains 100 games from highest to lowest Metacritic ranking. This web_scraper is capable of scraping the following data from each game: Link, Rank, Title, Date (release), Platform, Meta Score, and User Score. The user can choose how many web pages you request to scrape as well as which data to scrape for.

### Usage:
***
To run the Web_Scraper from the command line, the following initial input must be given:
```
python /web_scraper.py --n <numbers of pages to scrap> --cat <categories to scrap>
```
Where 'numbers of pages to scrape' must be an integer from 1 to 182. If no value is passed, it will scrape 1 page by default.

'Numbers of pages to scrape' are not case sensitive and their input order does not affect results. The input categories must be separated by " ".
If no values are passed, it will scrape Title and Rank by default.


See below an example:
```
python /web_scraper.py --n 10 --cat Rank Title Date
```
This command would result in the web_scraper scraping 10 webpages for the categories _Rank_, _Title_ and _Date_.
